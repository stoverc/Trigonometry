# Trigonometry
[My](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/publishers/resources?PublisherID=TheRealCStover) `Trigonometry` paclet for [The Wolfram Paclet Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository). <sup>([documentation](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/cstover/DeployedResources/Paclet/TheRealCStover/Trigonometry/))</sup>

      <code>Trigonometry</code> extends the built-in Wolfram Language trigonometry functionality by providing definitions for over 50 functions not currently included in the system.
      <br><br>
      We all know about <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and <code>tan</code>. Some of us may even know about <code>sec</code>, <code>arcsin</code>, <code>cosh</code>, and <code>arctanh</code>. A considerably smaller but still not-nonexistent group may know of <code>Haversine</code> and <code>InverseHaversin</code>. But...have you ever heard of <code>Covercosine</code>, <code>Excosecant</code>, and <code>Chord</code>?! Well if not, then this paclet is for you!
      <br><br>
        This Paclet gathers nearly a dozen little-used circular trig functions, their hyperbolic analogues, and the inverses of all of these, into a single, easy-to-use collection that works seamlessly with the 6,000+ Wolfram Language functions.

## TODO
* Fill in the (many!) doc pages for the ciruclar functions and their inverses.
* Implement hyperbolic fucntions and their inverses.
* Future iterations may also include various definitions of so-called <i>parabolic trig functions</i>, as well as some other juicy trig-related tidbits that prove useful!

  <summary><h3>26 Jun 2022</h3></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Made initial version of README.md. No idea why I didn't do this yesterday?</li>
    <li>Later, added a .png version of the graphic to the `img` directory.</li>
    <li>Later still, added a transparent version of the above-mentioned .png, and used it to update the README.md file to its current state.</li>

  <summary><h3>25 Jun 2022</h3></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Initial commit. This version contains definitions for the circular functions + their inverses, as well as a halfish-completed landing page, one guide page in progress, and nothing else. There is still much to be done here.</li>
